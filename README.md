# classifiers_pytorch
This code is intended to make training an image classification model easier and generalizable.

This repo is forked from Brigham Young University's Record Linking Lab. This fork is likely behind their version of the repo as I wanted to preserve only the work that I completed here. All code currently contained in this repo was authored by myself, with the help of internet resources such as chatGPT, pytorch docs, etc.
